### R1D2
**Today's Progress**:  DrumMachine App. Worked on to play the sound onclick,

**Thoughts:** . Today i decide to rebuild from scrath the app because i began to build the app a  long time ago (3 month, maximun), and when yesterday i began  to the app i feel like i didn't have a good appraoch 
or a good method so i decide to rebuild it from scratch with a new approach . 
I need to know to use keydown in react i think day 3 i will find how to do it in the app.
